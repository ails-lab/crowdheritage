          Cultural Heritage Organisations

        <p>
          CrowdHeritage was originally developed with the primary objective to support Cultural Heritage organisations,
          including museums, aggregators, archives, libraries etc, who wish to <strong>improve the quality of their collections’
          metadata</strong>. To this end, CrowdHeritage is employed to mobilise the intelligence of a larger or smaller groups of
          people  to annotate metadata with various types of information (e.g. with semantic terms from case-appropriate
          vocabularies, geo-locations, colors, free text tags etc). Such campaigns also act as means of raising awareness
          about CH organisations’ collections among wider audiences, including CH professionals, culture lovers,students,
          and  the general public.

          Citizen Science
        </h2>
        <p>
          CrowdHeritage has been used in citizen science settings that <strong>promote public engagement in scholarly research</strong>
          and contribute to broadening the accessibility of research results.  A series of such campaigns have been held,
          exemplifying how crowdsourcing and cultural heritage collections can be incorporated in tertiary education in
          accordance with open and citizen science principles.

        <p>
          CrowdHeritage has been extensively used in educational environments, involving schools from various European
          countries. Through their participation in crowdsourcing campaigns held in different languages, students are
          encouraged to tap into digital collections and learn useful information about certain subjects (from architecture
          and music to endangered species and the olympic games) in a playful  way. The participatory nature of the process
          has the potential to stimulate learning and engagement and add a collaborative and creative touch to more
          traditional teaching procedures.

          Evaluation of AI-produced annotations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Besides supporting users to add their own annotations from scratch, CrowdHeritage has also been extensively used
          for enabling users to evaluate automatic annotations produced by Artificial Intelligence tools. The automatic
          annotations can come in various forms, including colors detected by image analysis algorithms, machine translations
          of descriptive metadata, automatically identified  biased phrases, or images produced by super-resolution models. In such a setting, humans are asked to
          up-/downvote, score or rank the automatic outputs and the collected feedback is exploited to assess and improve
          the AI algorithms and apply appropriate thresholds to only maintain good-quality annotations. In this interplay
          with AI-driven enrichment tools, the CrowdHeritage platform can be used for producing labeled datasets amenable
          for the in-domain training of machine learning algorithms.
