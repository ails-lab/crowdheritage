  "intro"           : "<p>Crowdheritage is an open platform that supports the organisation of online crowdsourcing campaigns for the enrichment and validation of cultural heritage metadata. The platform is mainly used by cultural heritage organisations across Europe and beyond who wish to improve the quality of their collections and engage different target audiences in the process in a playful way. The enriched data can then be published in <a href='https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Europeana</a>, the European portal for cultural heritage, thus improving the searchability and usability of digital collections. The platform is also used by the educational community as well as in the context of citizen science initiatives. The platform had been originally developed by the <a href='https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>National Technical University of Athens</a> with the contribution of the European Commission under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) program. It is currently being administered and being further extended by  <a href='https://datoptron.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Datoptron</a>, a spinoff company of the National Technical University of Athens.</p><p style='display:flex;'><img style='margin:5px; width:50%;' src='../../../img/flyer1.jpg'><img style='margin:5px; width:50%;' src='../../../img/flyer2.jpg'></p>",
